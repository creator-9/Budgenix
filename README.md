# FinBuddy

A chat-based personal finance tool that helps users track expenses, control overspending, and understand their financial habits effortlessly. Instead of filling forms or maintaining spreadsheets, users can simply **chat** with the system to log expenses and receive budgeting advice.

## 🧠 Project Motivation

Most budgeting apps feel rigid and boring, causing people—especially students and early professionals—to avoid consistent expense tracking. We wanted to build something more natural, interactive, and effortless.

**So we created a budgeting tool that works through conversation.**

## 🌟 What the App Does

### ✔ Natural Chat-Based Expense Logging

Users can add expenses by typing messages like:  
_“Spent ₹250 on snacks today.”_

### ✔ Real-Time Spending Feedback

If the user overspends or gets close to category limits, the system gives instant suggestions and warnings.

### ✔ Purchase Justification & Guidance

Users can ask:  
_“Should I buy this?”_  
And receive structured, rule-based advice.

### ✔ Simple Dashboard for Insights

The UI provides:

- Category-wise spending (pie chart)
- Weekly/monthly trends (bar chart)
- Goal progress

### ✔ Personalized Onboarding

During setup, the system asks for income, goals, and spending categories to create a customized budget profile.
